# Microsoft Azure IoT solution accelerators 
You can deploy Azure IoT solution accelerators that implement common Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios to Microsoft Azure using your Azure subscription. You can use solution accelerators: 
- as a starting point for your own IoT solution. 
- to learn about the most common patterns in IoT solution design and development. 

Each solution accelerator implements a common IoT scenario and is a complete, end-to-end implementation. You can deploy the Azure IoT solution accelerator Connected Factory solution accelerator from [https://www.azureiotsolutions.com](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com), following the guidance outlined in [Quickstart: Try a cloud-based solution to manage my industrial IoT devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-accelerators/quickstart-connected-factory-deploy). In addition, you can download the complete source code from this repository to customize and extend the solution to meet your specific requirements. 

## Connected Factory solution accelerator
The Connected Factory solution accelerator illustrates how you can get started with your Industry 4.0 digital transformation. It brings together key Azure IoT services to enable the following features: OPC UA data ingestion, OPC UA server management, rules and actions and Azure Time Series Insights.

## Release Notes

#### Deployment Names
When using the build.ps1 script for deployment, it is recommended that you use a new deployment name each time you deploy the connected factory solution.

#### Connected Factory deployment Time
It takes approximately 14 minutes to complete the deployment.

#### Connected Factory telemetry Flow
After you have successfully deployed the solution and the web application launches the first time it takes approximately 3 minutes for data to show in the solution dashboard.

#### Azure Maps
Connected Factory supports the Azure Maps API to show factory locations in the dashboard. Please check the [Connected Factory FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-faq-cf) for more details.

#### Configure Connected Factory
The configuration of the Connected Factory solution accelerator is handled in more detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-connected-factory-configure).

#### Deploy an edge gateway for the Connected Factory
If you want to add a new gateway to the Connected Factory, please follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-connected-factory-gateway-deployment).

#### Simulation VM security
To upload and start the simulation in the VM, we are adding a public IP interface before we upload the VM scripts and executables. This interface is removed after the operation is completed. The network interface of the VM is protected by a network security group, which allows only outgoing connections on ports 5671 (AMPQS), 8883 (MQTTS) and 443 (TLS).
For the upload operation, the rule is extended to also allow incoming connections on port 22 (SSH). In the directory Simulation/Factory, you will find several PowerShell scripts, which allow you to add/remove 
public IP address or enable/disable the SSH allow rule for the VM.
If you need to change the configuration of the production line VM to allow inbound connections, e.g. to login via SSH, please make sure you are running a vulnerability check on the VM first and also install the latest patches by following the [instructions](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades) on the Ubuntu website.
